# Excel-Transportation-Dashboard
# 🚍 Transportation Analytics Dashboard (Excel)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing public transportation data using **Microsoft Excel**, with an emphasis on **operational efficiency, rider behavior, and revenue insights**.  
The analysis is presented through **two interactive dashboards** built using **Power Query** for data transformation and **Power Pivot** for data modeling and calculations.

The goal of this project is to convert raw transportation data into **actionable insights** that can help optimize routes, improve bus utilization, and enhance decision-making.

## 📊 Dashboard 1: Operational Performance & Utilization

### 🔹 Key KPIs
- **Total Passengers**
- **Average Riders per Trip**
- **Busiest Route**
- **Least Busy Route**

### 🔹 Insights & Analysis
- **Bus Utilization by Time Range**
  - Total passengers segmented by time of day
- **Peak vs Off-Peak Hours**
  - Identification of high and low demand periods
- **Yearly Rider Distribution**
  - Includes **Year-over-Year (YoY) change**
- **Weekly Rider Distribution**
  - Visualized using **line and bar charts**
- **Bus Utilization Rate**
  - Measures efficiency of bus usage
- **Riders by Moment of Trip**
  - Demand patterns based on trip timing

### 🔹 Improvement Suggestions
Based on utilization and demand trends, recommendations are provided to:
- Optimize schedules during off-peak hours  
- Improve resource allocation on underutilized routes  
- Increase service frequency during peak demand periods

## 📈 Dashboard 2: Demographics, Revenue & Route Insights

### 🔹 Key KPIs
- **Total Passengers**
- **Average Riders per Trip**
- **Total Revenue**
- **Total Trips**

### 🔹 Insights & Analysis
- **Total Riders Distribution by Route**
- **Top 5 Performing Buses**
- **Riders Distribution by Gender**
- **Riders Distribution by Age Group**
- **Riders Distribution by Occupation**

### 🔹 Interactive Features
- Slicers for:
  - **Gender**
  - **Year**
  - **Route Name**

These slicers allow dynamic filtering and deeper exploration of rider behavior and performance metrics.
